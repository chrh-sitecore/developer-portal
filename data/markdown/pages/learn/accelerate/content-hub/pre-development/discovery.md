## ![(blue star)](/images/learn/accelerate/content-hub/img/icons/emoticons/72/2049.png) **Context**

The Discovery phase is the cornerstone of a successful Sitecore Content Hub implementation. This stage establishes a clear understanding of the organization's needs, current systems, and goals, ensuring alignment across stakeholders and laying the groundwork for effective planning and execution.

## ![(lightbulb)](/images/learn/accelerate/content-hub/img/icons/emoticons/lightbulb_on.png) **Execution**

Discovery is more than just information gathering; it sets the tone and direction for the entire project. The primary objectives include understanding the current state by evaluating existing systems, workflows, and pain points, ensuring a clear picture of the organization’s starting point. It also focuses on defining success by aligning stakeholders on key goals, such as improved asset management, streamlined workflows, or enhanced user satisfaction. By addressing key questions and defining acceptance criteria for the solution, Discovery minimizes ambiguity, reduces risks, and lays the groundwork for success.

As we embark on a new Content Hub instance, it’s essential to thoroughly understand the organization’s objectives and challenges to create a comprehensive project plan that is both actionable and accurately estimated. This foundation ensures clarity, alignment, and a roadmap for achieving the desired outcomes.

### Key areas of focus during the Discovery phase

The first step in the discovery phase is to understand the problem by gaining a deep insight into user needs and challenges. This involves conducting user research through methods such as interviews, surveys, and analytics to gather valuable data. Mapping pain points, needs, and motivations helps create a clear picture of the obstacles users face and the outcomes they seek. Techniques like Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) and empathy maps can be employed to better understand user behavior, goals, and emotional drivers. This foundational understanding ensures that the solution is designed with the user at the center, addressing their most pressing needs effectively.

#### **Stakeholder Engagement**

Identifying key players is a crucial step in the Discovery phase to ensure that all relevant perspectives are included in the project. These players typically include business leaders who define the overarching objectives, IT teams responsible for managing technical setups and integrations, and end-users who will interact with the platform on a daily basis. Each group brings unique insights and priorities that are vital for the project's success.

To align these diverse stakeholders, facilitating workshops is essential. These sessions provide a collaborative space to define goals, set priorities, and manage expectations. Workshops not only ensure that everyone is on the same page but also create a sense of ownership and involvement among all participants, laying the groundwork for a smooth and successful implementation.

#### **Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)**

The Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework is a powerful tool for understanding customer needs by focusing on the specific "job" they want to accomplish. The key idea is that people "hire" products or services to achieve certain outcomes, whether functional, emotional, or social. For example, someone might "hire" a product with the job of providing a quick, healthy breakfast. To apply this framework, the first step is to identify the core "job" the customer is trying to complete. Next, explore the various dimensions of the job, including functional requirements (e.g., speed or ease of use), emotional factors (e.g., feeling healthy or organized), and social aspects (e.g., aligning with personal or cultural values). By designing solutions that address these needs comprehensively, businesses can create offerings that truly resonate with their customers and solve their problems effectively.

#### **Audit Legacy Systems**

Understanding the existing content ecosystem is a critical part of the Discovery phase. This involves a thorough evaluation of the current Digital Asset Management (DAM) and Product Content Management (PCM) tools in use. Identifying the limitations of these systems, such as poor search functionality or scalability issues, provides valuable insights into the pain points that need to be addressed in the new solution. Additionally, assessing the volume and structure of data, including the types of assets and the current metadata framework, helps in understanding the complexity and scope of the migration process.

As part of this assessment, it is equally important to highlight the features that must be retained to preserve continuity in operations. At the same time, areas for improvement should be identified to ensure the new implementation addresses existing challenges and provides enhanced functionality. This balanced evaluation forms the foundation for designing a system that meets both current needs and future business objectives.

#### **Define Success Metrics**

Establishing measurable goals is essential for ensuring the success of the Sitecore Content Hub implementation. These goals provide clear benchmarks for evaluating the effectiveness of the platform and aligning it with organizational objectives. One key goal is achieving time savings in workflows, enabling teams to work more efficiently by reducing manual effort and streamlining processes.

Another critical goal is improving content discoverability through enhanced metadata and well-structured taxonomies. This ensures users can quickly find and utilize assets, boosting productivity and operational efficiency. Additionally, increasing collaboration among teams is a vital objective, fostering better communication and coordination to enhance overall performance. These measurable goals create a framework for tracking progress and demonstrating the value of the implementation over time.

#### **Training for Project Teams**

Providing foundational training on Content Hub’s capabilities to key stakeholders is a crucial step in the Discovery phase. This training ensures that stakeholders gain a clear understanding of the platform’s features, functionalities, and potential. Equipped with this knowledge, stakeholders are better positioned to make informed decisions during subsequent phases of the project.

By familiarizing stakeholders with the capabilities of Content Hub early on, the training fosters alignment and confidence across teams. It enables participants to contribute meaningfully to discussions on workflows, configurations, and integrations, ensuring that decisions are rooted in a solid understanding of the platform. This foundational training ultimately sets the stage for a more efficient and effective implementation process.

## ![(blue star)](/images/learn/accelerate/content-hub/img/icons/emoticons/72/1f5e8.png) **Insights**

The Discovery phase is a critical step in the implementation of Sitecore Content Hub, and its success is defined by key deliverables that provide clarity, alignment, and actionable insights for the project. These deliverables serve as the foundation for effective planning and execution, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned and the project is set up for long-term success.

A Stakeholder Map is a vital output of Discovery, offering a clear definition of roles and responsibilities across teams. This ensures accountability and smooth collaboration, as every team member knows their part in the project. Paired with a Legacy System Audit, which documents current systems, data structures, and workflows, the organization gains a comprehensive understanding of its starting point. This audit highlights areas for improvement and informs how existing processes can be enhanced through Content Hub.

Another critical deliverable is the identification of Success Metrics, where agreed-upon KPIs are aligned with business goals. These metrics provide a measurable way to assess the project’s impact, keeping teams focused on achieving the desired outcomes. In addition, Training Completion ensures that core stakeholders are equipped with foundational knowledge of Sitecore Content Hub, enabling them to make informed decisions and contribute effectively throughout the project lifecycle.

Finally, the Initial Project Scope provides a high-level understanding of what the implementation will entail. It outlines the key objectives, phases, and anticipated outcomes, serving as a guide for the subsequent planning and execution stages. Together, these deliverables form a robust foundation for the project, minimizing risks, reducing ambiguity, and ensuring alignment across all stakeholders.
